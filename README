// Overview
lab3a.c: C source code that read the on-disk representation of a file system, analyzed it, and sumarrize its contents. This program analyzes the file system in the image file and output a summary to standard out. There were 5 parts to this code: super block, groups, free-lists, inodes, indirect blocks, and directories. After the C file is compiled, the executable takes an EXT2 file system disk image as argument. 

Makefile: has 3 targets
	default: 	compiles and produces the executable lab3a
	clean: 		removes the generated executable lab3a
	dist: 		creates the distribution tarball which includes lab3a.c,
				Makefile and README

README: Descriptions of the included files. Cites all the important websites/sources that helped us successfully write this program.
